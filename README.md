# Proyecto Integrador de ProgramaciÃ³n Orientada a Objetos

`MainClass.java` is the starting point. There, various settings can be adjusted at will.

This project has support for two kinds of games: platform with enemies and platform parkour.

## Button positions

All buttons are under the `ui` folder.

## Custom assets

Directly in the res folder, you can add custom assets to the game. Be sure to follow the same naming conventions and the same file size in pixels.

## Custom levels

To add custom levels, you can create a new text file in the levels folder. The file must contain the following:

- Block index will be taken from the red value of the rgb color of the pixel. The index 0 will be the upper left corner of the asset, and then from left to right and top to bottom, the following index values will be assigned in increments of 1.
- Block index 11 (can be changed in `HelpMethods`) is transparent, therefore not stopping the player from moving through.
- The block will be placed in the position of the pixel.
- The player's initial position will be taken from the green value of the rgb color of the pixel, it must be 100.
- The enemy's initial position will be taken from the green value of the rgb color of the pixel, it must be 0.
- For parkour mode, winning position will be taken from the blue value of the rgb color of the pixel, it must be 200.
